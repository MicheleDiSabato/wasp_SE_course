My research project is mostly based on mathematical statistics, rather than software engineering. For this reason, I chose papers that did not require very specific background knowledge. \\
Throughout my search, I did not find any misleading titles/abstracts. My search was limited to the accepted papers from any CAIN conference that were classified as "long papers".\\
